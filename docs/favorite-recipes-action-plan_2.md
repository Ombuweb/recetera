title: Favorite Recipes App Plan
---

### 1. Define the Core Features

- [Add a new recipe](./favorite-recipes-srs_1.md#add-a-new-recipe)
- [View all recipes](./favorite-recipes-srs_1.md#view-all-recipes)
- [Search for a recipe](./favorite-recipes-srs_1.md#search-for-a-recipe)
- [Share a recipe](./favorite-recipes-srs_1.md#share-a-recipe)

### 2. Choose the Technology Stack

- **Frontend and Backend**: Nuxt.js
- **Database**: Start with MySQL (will be designed to be database-agnostic)
- **Storage**: Cloud Storage (GCP) or Cloudflare R2
- **OCR**: TensorFlow.js
- **Mobile**: NativeScript-Vue

### 3. Design the User Interface

- **Web**: Responsive design using Nuxt.js with a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS and NuxtUI
- **Mobile**: Use NativeScript components for a native look and feel

### 4. Define the API Endpoints

- **POST /recipes**: Add a new recipe
- **GET /recipes**: Get all recipes
- **GET /recipes/:id**: Get a specific recipe
- **GET /recipes/search**: Search for recipes by name or tags
- **POST /recipes/share**: Share a recipe

### 5. Implement the Features

#### Add a New Recipe

- **Frontend**: Form to input recipe details, upload image, or paste a link
- **Backend**: Handle image upload, perform OCR with TensorFlow.js, crawl web pages, and save recipe data

#### View All Recipes

- **Frontend**: Display recipes in a list or grid view with pagination
- **Backend**: Fetch recipes from the database

#### Search for a Recipe

- **Frontend**: Search bar to input search queries
- **Backend**: Query the database for matching recipes

#### Share a Recipe

- **Frontend**: Share button to generate a shareable link or share via social media
- **Backend**: Generate and return a shareable link

### 6. Ensure Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Optimize loading times and database queries
- **Security**: Implement authentication and authorization, secure data storage
- **Usability**: Conduct user testing to ensure the app is easy to use

### 7. Cloud-Native Considerations

#### Scalability

- Use managed services like Firestore and Cloud Storage to handle scaling automatically.
- Implement auto-scaling for backend services using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Cloud Functions.

#### Resilience

- Use multi-region deployments to ensure high availability.
- Implement automated backups and disaster recovery plans using GCP's built-in tools.

#### Monitoring and Logging

- Use Google Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging for monitoring and logging.
- Set up alerts for critical metrics and errors.

#### CI/CD

- Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines using Google Cloud Build.
- Automate testing and deployment processes to ensure quick and reliable releases.

### 8. Dockerization

#### Docker Setup

- Create Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend services.
- Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.

### 9. Deployment

- **Backend**: Deploy on Google Cloud Run or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- **Frontend**: Deploy on Vercel or Netlify
- **Mobile**: Deploy on App Store and Google Play

### 10. Security

- Use Cloudflare for DNS management and DDoS protection.
- Implement HTTPS using Cloudflare's SSL/TLS services.
- Use Google Identity Platform for authentication and authorization.

### 11. Anonymous to Email Authentication with Firebase

#### Set Up Firebase

- Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
- Enable Authentication in the Firebase Console.
- Enable both Anonymous and Email/Password sign-in methods.

#### Initialize Firebase in Your App

- Add Firebase to your project and initialize it.

#### Implement Anonymous Authentication

- Allow users to sign in anonymously when they first use the app.

#### Implement Email Authentication

- Provide an option for users to upgrade to email authentication.
- Link the anonymous account to the email account.

#### Handle Data Migration

- Ensure that data associated with the anonymous user is retained when the account is upgraded to email authentication.

### 12. Maintenance

- Monitor the app for bugs and performance issues using Google Cloud Monitoring.
- Regularly update the app with new features and improvements.
